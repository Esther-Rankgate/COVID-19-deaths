# COVID-19-deaths
Plotly bar charts and world graphs are used in this project to analyse global COVID-19 data from 2020. Finding the number of deaths per 100,000 people is one method of assessing the impact of COVID-19 on a country in 2020. **_[View worldometer_coronavirus_summary_data.csv](data-and-code/worldometer_coronavirus_summary_data.csv)_**

```math
\frac{total\_deaths}{population} \times 100,000
```

## The Code 
Importing the libraries used in this project. 
```python
#import python modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```

Extract the columns, country name, total number of deaths, and population from the imported global corona virus data.  Make a new data frame with the extracted columns, then use Plotly to display it as a table.
```python
#import, sort and create new data frame
Data = pd.read_csv("worldometer_coronavirus_summary_data.csv")
countries = Data["country"].unique()
countryname = []
deaths = []
population = []

for country in countries: 
    currentcountry = Data[(Data['country'] == country)]
    countryname.append(country)
    deaths.append(currentcountry['total_deaths'].sum())
    population.append(currentcountry['population'].sum())

newData = pd.DataFrame({'Country': countryname,'Total_deaths': deaths, 'Population': population})

fig3 = go.Figure(data=[go.Table(
    header=dict(values=list(newData.columns),
                fill_color='paleturquoise',
                align='left'),
    cells=dict(values=[newData.Country, newData.Total_deaths, newData.Population],
               fill_color='lavender',
               align='left'))
])
pio.renderers.default = "browser"
fig3.show()
```

The total number of deaths per 100,000 persons in every country can be determined using this data. The data frame is then updated with this value, and a global map is produced.  The colour gradient shows the COVID-19 outbreak per country in terms of fatalities.

```python
#calculate total deaths per 100,000 in each country and display as colored map 
per = []
for i in range(0,226,1):
    result = (newData.iloc[i,1] / newData.iloc[i,2]) * 100000
    per.append(result)
perarray = np.array(per)

newData1 = pd.DataFrame({'Country': countryname,'Total deaths': deaths, 'Population': population, 'Death per 100,000': perarray})

fig = px.choropleth(
    newData1,
    locations="Country",
    locationmode="country names",         
    color="Death per 100,000",              
    hover_name="Country",           
    color_continuous_scale="Reds", 
    title="Covid 19 deaths per 100,000 by country 2020",
    scope="world",                
    projection="natural earth"
)

fig.update_layout(
    geo=dict(showframe=False, showcoastlines=True),
    margin=dict(l=0, r=0, t=50, b=0)
)

pio.renderers.default = "browser"
fig.show()
```

According to the map, South America had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2020. The country most impacted was Peru. A bar chart of COVID-19 deaths by South American countries is made by zoning into this area.

```python
#bar graph of COVID-19 fatality data in South America 
Data1 = Data[Data["continent"] == 'South America']

countries1 = Data1["country"].unique()
countryname1 = []
death = []
popu = []

for country in countries1:
    currentcountry = Data1[(Data1['country'] == country)]
    countryname1.append(country)
    death.append(currentcountry['total_deaths'].sum())
    popu.append(currentcountry['population'].sum())

newData2 = pd.DataFrame({'Country': countryname1, 'Total Deaths': death, 'Population': popu})

perr = []
for i in range(0,14,1):
    result = (newData2.iloc[i,1] / newData2.iloc[i,2]) * 100000
    perr.append(result)
perrarray = np.array(perr)

newData3 = pd.DataFrame({'Country': countryname1,'Death per 100,000': perrarray})

fig1 = px.bar(newData3, y='Death per 100,000', x='Country', text_auto='.2s',
            title="Total Deaths per 100,000 due to COVID 19 in South America")
fig1.update_traces(textfont_size=12, textangle=0, textposition="outside", cliponaxis=False)
pio.renderers.default = "browser"
fig1.show()
```

## COVID-19 in Peru 
In 2020, Peru had more COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants than any other country in the world. The country was placed under extreme lockdown as soon as the first case began on March 6, 2020. But the virus continued to spread throughout the nation and by December 31, 2020, there were 1,017,119 confirmed cases and 37,724 fatalities. Lack of hospitalisation and intensive care unit beds as a result of low healthcare investment rates may have contributed to an increase in deaths. There are roughly five intensive care unit beds for every 100,000 people in Peru, and there is a severe shortage of qualified medical personnel in the ICU.
